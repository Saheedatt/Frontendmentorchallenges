## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learnt about the use of flexbox and also tried to understand the use of selectors properly. Also tried to use 
the modern css styling


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.fylo-card{
    background-color: hsl(228, 56%, 26%);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    width: 300px;
    border-top-left-radius: 10px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
    border-top-right-radius: 90px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 5px;
}
```
